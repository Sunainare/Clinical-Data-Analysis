HISTORY    The patient is a 4 month old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16    A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis   The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta  PROCEDURE    After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia  the patient was prepped and draped   Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets   Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique  and the patient was heparinized   Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG  continuous pulse oximetry  and cycled cuff blood pressures  in addition to intravascular pressures  Using a percutaneous technique a 4 French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place   There was good blood return from both the ports  Using a 4 French sheath a 4 French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries   The atrial septum was not probe patent  Using a 4 French sheath a 4 French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta  ascending aorta and left ventricle   A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery   The transverse arch measured 5 mm   Isthmus measured 4 7 mm and coarctation measured 2 9 x 1 8 mm at the descending aorta level   The diaphragm measured 5 6 mm   The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter  which was then directed into the right innominate artery   This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist   Pressure pull back following angioplasty  however  demonstrated a residual of 15 20 mmHg gradient   Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing   The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist   The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull back measurement and final angiogram  Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption  Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta  After angiography  two normal appearing renal collecting systems were visualized   The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis   The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition   There were no complications  DISCUSSION    Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal   Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia   There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt   Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch  Phasic right sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A wave similar to the normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg   Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull back to the descending aorta   The calculated flows were mildly increased   Vascular resistances were normal   A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels   There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta   Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde   Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta  there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg   There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull back to the descending aorta   The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values   Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus   There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries   The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4 9 x 4 2 mm  DIAGNOSES    1   Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta  2   Dilated cardiomyopathy  3   Bicuspid aortic valve  4   Patent foramen ovale  INTERVENTION    Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta  MANAGEMENT    The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference   The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery   The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4 6 months   The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr  X 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Closed type III supracondylar fracture  left distal humerus  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  1   Closed type III supracondylar fracture  left distal humerus  2   Tethered brachial artery  left elbow  PROCEDURE PERFORMED    Closed reduction percutaneous pinning  left distal humerus  SPECIFICATIONS    The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite  room  2 at ABCD General Hospital   A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr  X with separate dictation by him  HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS    This is a 4 year old white male  apparently dominantly right handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing   He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm   He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow   His parents  were both present preoperatively   His x ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region   Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar  median  and radial nerves to be mostly intact  although a complete exam was impossible   He did have a radial pulse palpable  PROCEDURE    After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages  risks  complications  and expectations with the patient s parents including malunion  nonunion  gross deformity  growth arrest  infection  loss of elbow motions  stiffness  instability  need for surgery in the future  nerve problems  artery problems  and compartment syndrome  they elected to proceed  The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department   Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner   Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly   Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out   The elbow was hyperflexed   Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0 045 K wires placed first  one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve   The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C arm  After this  pulse was attempted to be palpated distally   Prior to the procedure  I talked to Dr  X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital   He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally   This was not present palpatory  but also by Doppler   A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler   Because of this  the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion type sound just above the fracture site or           A long discussion was carried out with Dr  X and myself  and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery   Prior to this  I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient s parents  the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this   I then came back in and then we proceeded   He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner   Please see Dr  X s report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery   There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site  the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site  thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally   Once it was released  both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler  the patient had bounding pulses  We then proceeded to close utilizing a  4 0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running  5 0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure   Steri Strips were placed   The patient s arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position   He was splinted posteriorly   Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient s pin sites   K wires have been bent  cut  and pin caps placed  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above   There is concern for growth plate disturbance   He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re perfusing compartment syndrome  A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight  but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning   There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion  overall cosmetic elbow alignment  and elbow function

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES    Bilateral cleft lip and bilateral cleft of the palate  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES    Bilateral cleft lip and bilateral cleft of the palate  PROCEDURE PERFORMED    Repair of bilateral cleft of the palate with vomer flaps  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS    40 mL  COMPLICATIONS    None  ANESTHESIA    General endotracheal anesthesia  CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE    Stable  extubated  and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition  INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE    The patient is a 10 month old baby with a history of a bilateral cleft of the lip and palate   The patient has undergone cleft lip repair  and she is here today for her cleft palate operation   We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure  risks  and benefits  the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding  infection  dehiscence  scarring  the need for future revision surgeries   We will proceed with surgery  DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE    The patient was taken into the operating room  placed in the supine position  and general anesthetic was administered   A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given   The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr  X  from Ear  Nose  and Throat Surgery   After he was done with his procedure  the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees   The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut   A Dingman retractor was placed   The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1 200 000  a total of 3 mL  and then  I proceeded with the prepping and draping   The patient was prepped and draped   I proceeded to do the palate repair   The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides   I will describe one side   The other side was done exactly in the same manner   The 2 hemiuvulas are placed  holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1 200 000  triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked   This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised   This was done on both uvulas   Then  an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa   A 1 mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better   Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate  the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue  2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa   Then  I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15 blade   The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap   Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer  and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed   Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel   The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator   The greater auricular foramen was exposed  and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap   Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle   The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially   This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner  and then            dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa  it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together   At this point  the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps   The flaps are            infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book   The incision was done with a 15C blade   The vomer flaps were dissected  and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate   This was approximated on both sides with 5 0 chromic running and interrupted stitches  and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5 0 chromic and a 4 0 chromic   Then 2 stitches of 4 0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side  on the other side  and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate   The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4 0 Vicryl and 4 0 chromic interrupted stitches   The throat pack was removed   The palate was cleaned   The Dingman retractor was removed  and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2 0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm   The patient tolerated the procedure without complications   BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm   I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure   The sponge  needle  and instrument count were completed at the end of the procedure   The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition

Closed open reduction and internal fixation of right ankle  ANESTHESIA    Spinal with sedation  COMPLICATIONS    None  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS    Minimal  TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME    75 minutes at 325 mmHg  COMPONENTS    Synthes small fragment set was used including a 2 5 mm drill bed   A six hole one third tibial plate  one 12 mm 3 5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3 5 mm cortical fully threaded screws   There were two 20 mm 4 0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4 0 cancellous screw placed   There were two 4 0 cancellous partially threaded screws placed  GROSS FINDINGS    Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS    The patient is an 87 year old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall   The patient noted while walking with a walker  apparently tripped and fell   The patient had significant comorbidities  seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room   At that time  a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert Jones splint   After complete medical workup and clearance  we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care  PROCEDURE    After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family  informed consent was obtained   The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon  the patient  the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia   The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite  3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position   At this time  the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation   All bony prominences were well padded at this time   A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient   This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion   The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes   Next  after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified  a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle   A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures   Once the bone was reached  the fractured site was identified   The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site   The wound was copiously irrigated and dried   Next  the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position   There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone   It was held in place with reduction forceps   A six hole one third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation   It was contoured using          and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula   Next  the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2 5 mm drill bed  depth gauged and then a 3 5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each   The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length   Next  the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2 5 mm drill bed  depth gauged  and a 4 0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole   The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length   Next the Xi scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position  all hardware was in good position   There was no lateralization of the joints   Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle   Again  after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified  a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus   Again  the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site   The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures   Once the fracture site was identified  it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum   The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus   There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus  but no loose bodies   Next  the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry   The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1 25 mm K wire   Next  the 2 5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4 0 cancellous screws were placed in each  each with a 45 mm in length   These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position   Again  Xi scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws   They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint   At this time  each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry   The wounds were then closed using  2 0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin   A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic  4x4s  Kerlix  and Webril   A Robert Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity   This was covered by a 4 inch Depuy dressing   At this time  the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation   The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit   The patient tolerated the procedure well   There were no complications 
CLEAR CORNEAL TEMPORAL INCISION  NO STITCHES  DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION    Under satisfactory local anesthesia  the patient was appropriately prepped and draped   A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye  The secondary incision was then made through clear cornea using 1 mm diamond keratome at surgeon s 7 30 position and the anterior chamber re formed using viscoelastic   The primary incision was then made using a 3 mm diamond keratome at the surgeon s 5 o clock position and additional viscoelastic injected into the anterior chamber as needed   The capsulorrhexis was then performed in a standard circular tear fashion   The nucleus was then separated from its cortical attachments by hydrodissection and emulsified in the capsular bag   The residual cortex was then aspirated from the bag and the bag re expanded using viscoelastic   The posterior chamber intraocular lens was then inspected  irrigated  coated with Healon and folded  and then placed into the capsular bag under direct visualization   The lens was noted to center well   The residual viscoelastic was then removed from the eye and the eye re formed using balanced salt solution   The eye was then checked and found to be watertight  therefore  no suture was used   The lid speculum and the drapes were then removed and the eye treated with Maxitrol ointment  A shield was applied and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Right distal both bone forearm fracture  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Right distal both bone forearm fracture  INDICATIONS    Mr  ABC is a 10 year old boy who suffered a fall resulting in a right distal both bone forearm fracture   Upon evaluation by Orthopedic Surgery team in the emergency department  it was determined that a closed reduction under conscious sedation and application of a splint was warranted   This was discussed with the parents who expressed verbal and written consent  PROCEDURE    Conscious sedation was achieved via propofol via the emergency department staff   Afterwards  traction with re creation of the injury pattern was utilized to achieve reduction of the patient s fracture   This was confirmed with image intensifier   Subsequently  the patient was placed into a splint   The patient was aroused from conscious sedation and at this time it was noted that he had full sensation throughout radial  median  and ulnar nerve distributions and positive extensor pollicis longus  flexor pollicis longus  dorsal and palmar interossei  DISPOSITION    Post reduction x rays revealed good alignment in the AP x rays   The lateral x rays also revealed adequate reduction   At this time  we will allow the patient to be discharged home and have him follow up with Dr  XYZ in one week

REASON FOR CATHETERIZATION    ST elevation myocardial infarction  PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN 1   Left coronary system cineangiography  2   Right coronary system cineangiography  3   Left ventriculogram  4   PCI to the left circumflex with a 3 5 x 12 and a 3 5 x 8 mm Vision bare metal stents postdilated with a 3 75 mm noncompliant balloon x2  PROCEDURE    After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient  informed consent was obtained   The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite   Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion   Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique   A 6 French sheath was introduced   Next  Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views   Next  an EBU 3 5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system   Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99  proximal left circumflex stenosis   Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT  which was 180  and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion   Next  a 3 0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre dilate the lesion   Next a 3 5 x 12 mm Vision bare metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres   There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent   Therefore  a 3 5 x 8 mm Vision bare metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres   Next  a 3 75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds   Final images showed excellent results with initial 99  stenosis reduced to 0    The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch   At this point  wire was removed   Final images confirmed initial stent results  no evidence of dissection  perforation  or complications  Next  an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity   LV pressure was measured   LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded   Finally  all guides were removed   Right femoral artery access site was imaged and Angio Seal deployed to attain excellent hemostasis   The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications  DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS 1   Left main   Left main is a large caliber vessel bifurcating in LAD and left circumflex with no significant disease  2   The LAD   LAD is a large caliber vessel  wraps around the apex  gives off multiple septal perforators  three small to medium caliber diagonal branches without any significant disease  3   Left circumflex   Left circumflex is a large caliber vessel  gives off a large distal PDA branch  has a 99  proximal lesion  50  mid vessel lesion  and a 50  lesion in the OM  which is a distal branch  4   Right coronary artery   Right coronary artery is a moderate caliber vessel  dominant  bifurcates into PDA and PLV branches  has only mild disease   Otherwise  no significant stenosis noted  5   LV   The LVEF 50    Inferolateral wall hypokinesis   No significant mitral regurgitation   No gradient across the aortic valve on pullback  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN    ST elevation myocardial infarction with a 99  stenosis of the proximal portion of the left circumflex treated with a 3 5 x 12 mm Vision bare metal stent and a 3 5 x 8 mm Vision bare metal stent   Excellent results  0  residual stenosis   The patient continues to have some residual 50  stenosis in the left circumflex system  some mild disease throughout the other vessels   Therefore  we will aggressively treat this patient medically with close followup as an outpatient 

PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN 1   Left coronary system cineangiography  2   Right coronary system cineangiography  3   Cineangiography of SVG to OM  4   Cineangiography of LIMA to LAD  5   Left ventriculogram  6   Aortogram  7   Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stent  NARRATIVE    After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient  informed consent was obtained   The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite   The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion   Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6 French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta   Next  Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system   Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views   Next  Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system   Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views   Next  the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM   Cineangiography was recorded   Next  the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J wire for a 4 French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views   Next  an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity   LV pressures were measured   LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded   Next  an aortogram was done and recorded   At this point  I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex   Therefore  AVA 3 5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery   Angiomax bolus and drip was started   Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2 5 balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres   Next  we attempted to advance a 3 0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion  however  we were unable to pass the stent   Next  second dilatations were done again with the 2 5 balloon at 18 atmospheres  however  we are unable to break the lesion   We next attempted a cutting balloon   Again  we are unable to cross the lesion  therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire   Again  we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent   We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon  which we were unsuccessful   We also try to cutting balloon again  we were unsuccessful   Despite multiple dilatations  we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion  therefore  finally the procedure was aborted   Final images showed no evidence of dissection  perforation  or further complication   The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results   The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications  was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor  DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS 1   The LV   LVEDP was 4   LVES is approximately 50  55  with inferobasal hypokinesis   No significant MR  No gradient across the aortic valve  2   Aortogram   The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection   The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies   The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities  3   The left main   The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel  bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10  20   4   Left circumflex   The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch   The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70  80  stenosis   The mid left circumflex is a high grade 80  diffuse tortuous stenosis  5   LAD   The LAD is a totally 100  occluded vessel   The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small to moderate caliber LAD   There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60  70    The diagonal shows proximal 80  stenosis  6   The right coronary artery   The right coronary artery is 100  occluded   There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches   The SVG to OM is 100  occluded at its take off   The SVG to PDA is not found  however  presumed 100  occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right  7   LIMA to LAD is widely patent  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN    Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system  only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty  unable to pass stents  noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon   Final images showed some improvement  however  continued residual stenosis   At this point  the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored   We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management   The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal  however  due to the length of this procedure  I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch   Possible consideration would be a stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia  focus on treatment to that lesion

abdominal pain   She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously   Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia   She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile  however  she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy s sign and voluntary guarding with examination   Her transaminases were markedly elevated   She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones   Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening  but evidence of cholelithiasis   She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis   Following this  she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy   Her parents were explained the risks  benefits  and complications of the procedure   She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery  OPERATIVE PROCEDURE    The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position   Preoperatively  the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef  sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin   The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution   Utilizing a  15 blade scalpel  a transverse infraumbilical incision was created   Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp  the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty   Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty   The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon dioxide   Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated  a  10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty   Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings   The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed   A  15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline   The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament   Next  two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization  one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line   These were inserted without difficulty   The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder   Utilizing Endoshears scissor  a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions   Next  the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct   A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch   This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place   Next  the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly   Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor  Once the clips were noted to be in place  utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall   The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery   The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline   The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port   There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder   Once the abdomen was re insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed  all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall   Utilizing  0 Vicryl suture  a figure of eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty   The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia   A  4 0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions   The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0 25  Marcaine   All ports were then cleaned dry   Steri Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this   The patient tolerated the entire procedure well   She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition   She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS  ES   1  Cholelithiasis  2  Cholecystitis  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS  ES   1  Acute perforated gangrenous cholecystitis  2  Cholelithiasis  PROCEDURE  1  Attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy  2  Open cholecystectomy  ANESTHESIA   General endotracheal anesthesia  COUNTS   Correct  COMPLICATIONS   None apparent  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS   275 mL  SPECIMENS  1  Gallbladder  2  Lymph node  DRAINS   One 19 French round Blake  DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION   After consent was obtained and the patient was properly identified  the patient was transported to the operating room and after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia  the patient was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion  After infiltration with local  a vertical incision was made at the umbilicus and utilizing graspers  the underlying fascia was incised and was divided sharply  Dissecting further  the peritoneal cavity was entered  Once this done  a Hasson trocar was secured with  1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty  A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space  A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area  this was a 10 12 mm non bladed trocar  Once this was done  a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin  this was a 5 mm port placed  it was non bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty  A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum  it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open  The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10 12 subxiphoid port  The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery  as well as the muscles and fascia  The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space  Then utilizing a right angle and electrocautery  the omentum was freed from the gallbladder  An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed  in which  electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa  this was done down to the infundibulum  After meticulous dissection  the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3 0 silks  Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified  was skeletonized  and a 3 0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it  After it was divided  the gallbladder was freed from the field  Once this was done  the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery  Copious irrigation was also used  A 19 French Blake drain was placed in Morrison s pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2 0 nylon  this was a 19 French round Blake  Once this was done  the umbilical port was closed with  1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with  1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion  The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia  extubated  and transported to the recovery room in stable condition 

PROCEDURE   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy  INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE   Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis  with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal appearing ampulla  MEDICATIONS   General anesthesia  The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction  bleeding  perforation  aspiration  and post ERCP pancreatitis  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE   After informed consent and appropriate sedation  the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx  down the esophagus  and into the stomach  The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla  The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance  as it was enlarged and very prominent  It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape  It had what appeared to be adenomatous appearing mucosa on the tip  There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla  The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified  This was located not at the tip of the ampulla  but rather more towards the base  Cannulation was performed with a Wilson Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree  The common bile duct was mildly dilated  measuring approximately 12 mm  The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated  There were no filling defects identified  There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct  but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla  The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically  Nevertheless  it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment  This was done without any complications  There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure  Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy  however  because of the shape of the ampulla  this was unsuccessful  Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position  but still were unsuccessful  Next  biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice  Four biopsies were taken  There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure  The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn  FINDINGS  1  Abnormal papilla with bulging  polypoid appearance  and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip  biopsies taken  2  Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture  although I think this is likely an anatomic variant  brush cytology obtained  3  Unable to access the pancreatic duct  RECOMMENDATIONS  1  NPO except ice chips today  2  Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy  3  Follow up biopsies and cytology 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Left chest wall tumor  spindle cell histology  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Left chest wall tumor  spindle cell histology with pathology pending  PROCEDURE    Resection of left chest wall tumor  partial resection of left diaphragm  left lower lobe lung wedge resection  left chest wall reconstruction with Gore Tex mesh  ANESTHESIA    General endotracheal  SPECIMEN    Left chest wall with tumor and left lower lobe lung wedge resection to pathology  INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE    The patient is a 79 year old male who began to experience back pain approximately 2 years ago  which increased   Chest x ray and CT scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening   A biopsy was performed at an outside hospital  Kaiser  and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma   The patient had a metastatic workup  which was negative including a brain MRI and bone scan   The bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor   The patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease  hypertension  non insulin dependent diabetes  longstanding atrial fibrillation  anemia  and hypercholesterolemia   He and his family were apprised of the high risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained  PROCEDURE IN DETAIL    The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position   The patient was intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube   Intravenous antibiotics were given   A Foley catheter was placed   The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion   An incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass   The skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery   Good hemostasis was obtained   The tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib   A thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space   Inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions  which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection   The thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly   It was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor  approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected   The ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect   The ribs 7  8  9  and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery   Hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips   The chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly   It was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement   Inferiorly  the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor   The spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected   Inferiorly  the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace   The dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine   The left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the GIA 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe  which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung   A 2 0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection   Posteriorly  the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately T8 and T9  where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies   The ribs were disarticulated  closed to or at their articulations with the spine   Bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery   There was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta  The posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section   The specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room   Hemostasis was obtained   The vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure of 8  1 Ethibond sutures   This produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension   A single 32 French chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly   This was secured with a  1 silk suture   The Gore Tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect   A series of  1 Prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually   The resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate   The serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure of 8 0 Vicryl   The latissimus was reapproximated with a two  1 Vicryl placed in running fashion   Of note  two  10 JP drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall   The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3 0 Vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4 0 Monocryl   The wounds were dressed   The patient was brought from the operating room directly to the North ICU  intubated in stable condition   All counts were correct

team present   Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord   Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision   In addition  the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex   A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions   These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall   Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall         into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries   Bilateral tubal ligation performed without difficulty via Parkland technique  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS    500 mL  COMPLICATIONS    None  URINE OUTPUT    Per anesthesia records   Urine cleared postoperatively  IV FLUIDS    Per anesthesia records  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition with stable vital signs  OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE    The patient was placed in a supine position after spinal epidural anesthesia   She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section   A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar   This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife   This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors   Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient s previous surgeries   Upon entry  incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision   Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer   A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus   Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall   This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall   Inferiorly  difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall   These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp  blunt  and electrocautery dissection   This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder   Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus   The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision   This was extended with bandage scissors   The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation   Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body   The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present   Cord segment and cord blood was obtained   Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord   Vigorous male infant  Apgars 9 9  weight 6 pounds 14 ounces   Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved   Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity   Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining   Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip   A  1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure   Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure   Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul de sac to remove any blood or clots   The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity  after using  1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision  that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion   This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis   Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation   Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated   Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx   Proximal and distal  1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed   The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery   This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion   Upon completion of tubal ligation  uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity   Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry   Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis   Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2 0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion  partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done   Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect   The midline rectus including peritoneum was re approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures   Irrigation of the muscular layer with good hemostasis noted   The fascia was closed with  1 Vicryl in a running continuous closure   Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated  additional hemostasis with Bovie cautery   The skin was closed with staples

was carried down sharply down the skin  subcutaneous tissue and the fascia   Deep fascia was exposed   The tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmHg prior to the skin incision   A standard medial parapatellar approach was made   The quadriceps tendon was incised approximately 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion   Incision was then carried down distally and distal arthrotomy was completed   Patellar tendon was well protected   Retinaculum and capsule was incised approximately 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair   The knee was exposed very well   Significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted   The osteophytes were removed with a rongeur   Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were excised   Medial and lateral meniscectomies were performed   Medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the proximal tibia to address the varus deformity   The medial compartment was more affected than lateral   Medial ligaments were tied   Retropatellar fat pad was excised   Osteophytes were removed   Using a Cobb elevator  the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected  Attention was placed for the preparation of the femur   The trochlear notch was ossified   A rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an intramedullary drill guide  a starting hole was created slightly anterior to the PCL attachment   The anterior portal was 1 cm anterior to the PCL attachment   The anterior femoral sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of external rotation   Rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and Whiteside line   The pins were positioned in the appropriate holes   Anterior femoral cut was performed after placing the cutting guide   Now  the distal cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned   A distal femoral cut was made which was satisfactory   A sizer was positioned which was noted to be D   The 5 in 1 cutting block size D was secured with spring pins over the resected bone   Using an oscillating saw  cuts were made in a sequential manner such as anterior condyle  posterior condyle  anterior chamfer  and posterior chamfer   Then using a reciprocating saw  intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made   Following this  the cutting block for High Flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle   Using a reciprocating saw  the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed   The bone with its attached soft tissue was removed   Once the femoral preparation was completed  attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia   The medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor   The PCL retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly   Osteophytes were removed   The extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1 3rd of the tibial tubercle   Similarly  horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1 3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe   Once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane  the tibial EM guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest   A built in 7 degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation   Now  the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially  which was the most affected site   Tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane   The resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site   The resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially   Now  attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle   Using curved osteotome  angle curette  and a rongeur  the posterior osteophytes were removed   Now  attention was placed for confirming the flexion extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion   Rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension   The 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension  Attention was now placed for completion of the tibia   Size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned   Appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod   Reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before   The midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1 3rd of the tibial tubercle   The rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor   At this point  trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner   The range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory   No further soft tissue release was indicated   I was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee  Attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella   Using a patellar caliper  the thickness was measured to be 21 5 mm   This gives an ideal resection of 8 5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact   Reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide   Using a caliper  the resected patella was measured  which was noted to be 13 mm   A 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well   Drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty   The tracking was satisfactory   There was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella   The trial components position was satisfactory   The alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory   All the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system   The resected surfaces were dried with a sponge   Two batches of Palacos cement were mixed   The cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella   Excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife   The knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner   Patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all poly patella   Once the cement was set hard and cured  tourniquet was deflated   Hemostasis was achieved   The trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive Prolong highly cross linked polyethylene liner   Range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees   Anterior posterior drawer test was satisfactory   Medial and lateral stability was satisfactory   Patellar tracking was satisfactory   The wound was thoroughly irrigated   Hemostasis was achieved   A local cocktail was injected  which included the mixture of 0 25  plain Marcaine  30 mg of Toradol  and 4 mg of morphine   The quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with  1 Vicryl in figure of 8 fashion   The subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2 0 Vicryl and 0 Vicryl followed by 2 0 Vicryl proximally   The skin was approximated with staples   Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform  4x4  ABD  and Bias   The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition   There were no intraoperative complications noted   She tolerated the procedure very well 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Cecal polyp  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS    Cecal polyp  PROCEDURE    Laparoscopic resection of cecal polyp  COMPLICATIONS    None    ANESTHESIA    General oral endotracheal intubation  PROCEDURE    After adequate general anesthesia was administered the patient s abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically   Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made   Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps   A bladed 11 mm port was inserted without difficulty   Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02   Under direct vision 2 additional  non bladed  11 mm trocars were placed  one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant   There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel   The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve   This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice   The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal   The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye   There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp   The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely  The specimen was then removed through the 12 mm port and examined on the back table   The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear   I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon   This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined   There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear   The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution   There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery   The trocars were removed under direct vision   No bleeding was noted   The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure of eight O Vicryl suture   All skin incisions were closed with running 4 0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures   Mastisol and Steri Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing   The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications

fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration   The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone   The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment   Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved  INDICATION    The patient is a 53 year old female with a history of malignant melanoma  who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture   She denied any history of fall or trauma   The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment   Indication  risks  and benefits were discussed   Treatment options were reviewed   No guarantees have been made or implied  PROCEDURE    The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved  she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up   The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion   Time out procedure was called   Antibiotics were infused  A standard posterolateral approach was made   Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus   This was then incised along the line of the incision   Hemostasis was achieved   Charnley retractor was positioned   The trochanter was intact   The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor   The piriformis and minimus junction was identified   The minimus was also reflected along with the medius   Using Bovie and knife  the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion   Similarly  L shaped capsulotomy was performed   A  5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair   Fracture site was exposed   The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low lying basicervical type   Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew   The head size was measured to be 43 mm   Bony fragments were removed   The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated   A 43 mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability   The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site  which was abnormal with grayish discoloration   This was sent to the pathology   The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively  decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem   An L shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis   The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter   There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter   The L shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis   Hemostasis was achieved   Now  the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder   The fracture site was well exposed   Satisfactory lateralization was performed   Attention was for the reaming process   Using a size 1 reamer  the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3  which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal   At this point  a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted   Appropriate anteversion was positioned   The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation   The bony edges were trimmed   The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well   There was no evidence of any subsidence   At this point  trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length   The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory   The hip was well reduced without any difficulty   The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion adduction  internal rotation was satisfactory   The shuck was less than 1 mm   Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg   Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75 80 degrees of internal rotation   Similarly  keeping the leg completely adducted  I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees   After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction  trial components were removed   The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely   At this point  2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed   The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected   Centralizer was positioned   The cement restrictor was inserted   Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried   Using cement gun  retrograde cementing was performed   The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion  which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured   The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator   All the cement debris was removed  Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head   Once again  0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion   It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory   I also attempted with a  3 trial head  but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability  range of motion  as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal   The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation   There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion adduction  internal rotation   I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees  which was noted to be very stable   At this point  a definitive component using  0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced   Range of motion and stability was as above   Now  the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis   This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using  5 Ethibond and suture plaster   Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the  5 Ethibond   The wound was thoroughly irrigated   Hemostasis was achieved   The fascia was closed with  1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2 0 Vicryl   The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures   Skin was approximated with staples   Sterile dressings were placed   Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition   There were no intraoperative complications noted
