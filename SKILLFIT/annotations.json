["The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of diabetes mellitus. He was doing fairly well until last week while mowing the lawn, he injured his right foot. He presented to the Hospital Emergency Room. Cultures taken from the wound on 06/25/2008, were reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin and later on that was changed to oral formulation. The patient underwent debridement of the wound on 07/29/2008. Apparently, MRI and a bone scan was performed at that facility, which was reported negative for osteomyelitis. The patient was then referred to the wound care center at General Hospital. From there, he has been admitted to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for wound care with wound VAC placement. On exam, he has a lacerated wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area, closed with the area of the head of these bones. The wound itself is deep and stage IV and with exam of her gloved finger in my opinion, the third metatarsal bone is palpable, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The patient has serosanguineous drainage in this wound and it tracks under the skin in all directions except distal.
